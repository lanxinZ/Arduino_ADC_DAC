# Arduino_ADC_DAC
Task given by M. Cui, who designed a pcb for testing his IC. 
The DACs and ADC on the pcb are controlled by Arduino Nano Every (https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-every) using i2c. After flashed, commands could be sent to Arduino (through the COM Port) either directly in Serial Monitor or with help of the python script.

Here I'd like to thank the Author and highlight his project:
